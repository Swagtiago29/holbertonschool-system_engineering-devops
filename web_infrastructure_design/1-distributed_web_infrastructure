    Why Add Each Element?
2 Web Servers (Nginx): Increases availability and redundancy; if one fails, the other can handle traffic

Load Balancer (HAProxy): Distributes traffic between web servers, improving scalability and fault tolerance

Application Server (PHP): Handles dynamic content and business logic

Database Cluster (Primary-Replica): Provides scalability and availability; primary handles writes, replicas handle reads

1. Load Balancer Algorithm:
Round Robin: Evenly distributes traffic to all web servers
Least Connections: Routes traffic to the server with the fewest active connections

2. Active-Active vs. Active-Passive:
Active-Active: Both servers handle traffic. No downtime if one fails
Active-Passive: One server handles all traffic; the other only activates if the first fails

3. Primary-Replica Database Cluster:
Primary (Master): Handles writes (insert/update)
Replica (Slave): Handles reads and replicates data from the primary

    Issues with This Infrastructure:
SPOF: If the load balancer or primary database fails, it can cause downtime
Security: No firewall or HTTPS, leaving the system vulnerable
No Monitoring: Lack of tools to track server health and performance
